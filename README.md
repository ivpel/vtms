## VTMS

This **Test Management System** is my pet project which was development mostly for **educational** purpose. Even it is fully
functional - it was not planned for production use.
It allows you to create projects, suites and cases to manage your tests.

Also, as it build using **Django**, it comes with a user authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user 
sessions.
